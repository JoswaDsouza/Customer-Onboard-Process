Almost all production bots will require some use of selection statements (if/else) and repetition (looping). In this challenge, new corporate customers must be added to The Cable Co's customer relationship management system. Download the new customers' CSV and correctly enter the customer onboarding details for each new customer. The scoring modal will display your results once all new customers have been added.
